Step 2: I did set up the api folder but I am waiting on the code review before adding the backend of the REST API to the full stack app. UPDATE: done but should be checked!!

Step 3: Decided to go with the npm package instead of the middleware as this was used in the last proj.
installed with npm i cors at the root of the folder. Required and used cors in the api folder, within app.js in lines 1 and 15. This is working.npm

Step 4: the api seems to be working fine. the client seems to have an issue. The creat-react-app development server started but the list of courses that I called did not render. Not sure bc the React Authentication proj used components, and other projects have used pug files. 
    Not sure what to do with: Update the React App component (src/App.js file) to call the REST API to get a list of courses and render the results.
We're just confirming the setup of the applications, so just render the list of course titles using some simple markup (e.g. an unordered list or set of divs).

Step 5: Why is the CSS not applying?
