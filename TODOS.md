Step 2: p9 passed, added api

Step 3: Decided to go with the npm package instead of the middleware as this was used in the last proj.
installed with npm i cors at the root of the folder. Required and used cors in the api folder, within app.js in lines 1 and 15. This is working. 

Step 4: Check!

Step 5:
